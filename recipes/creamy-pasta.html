<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This easy meal uses cream cheese to add an extra creamy texture to ingredients that are usually on hand. Quick and delicious!</p>

<h4>Ingridients</h4>
<ul>
   <li>1 (12 ounce) package farfalle (bow tie) pasta</li>
   <li>1/2 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
   <li>1 (24 ounce) jar pasta sauce</li>
   <li>1 teaspoons Italian seasoning</li>
   <li>1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
   <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
   <li>1 onion, minced</li>
   <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
   <li>1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>

</ul>

<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the bow-tie pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain and return pasta to pot. Melt cream cheese into the pasta. Stir pasta sauce, Italian seasoning, and red pepper flakes into the pasta mixture.</li>
    <li>Heat a skillet over medium heat. Break ground beef into small pieces and add to the skillet; cook and stir until some of the fat has rendered, 2 to 3 minutes. Add onion and garlic to the beef, continue cooking until the ground beef is completely browned, about 5 minutes more. Stir beef mixture into the pasta mixture.</li>
    <li>Pour pasta-and-beef mixture into a 3-quart casserole dish. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese over the dish.</li>
    <li>Bake in preheated oven until the mozzarella cheese melts, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
